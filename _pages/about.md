I'm a senior student majoring in Computer Science (IEEE Honor Class) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

I am currently conducting research on long context modeling of Large Language Models (LLMs) at the Generative Artificial Intelligence Research Lab (GAIR), under the guidance of [Prof. Pengfei Liu](http://pfliu.com/). Prior to this, I specialized in tool learning within LLMs, working closely with [Prof. Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/).

# Research

I'm interested in natural language processing, especially augmenting large language models. My current interests mainly lie in the following:

- **Long Context Modeling**

- **Tool Learning**

- **Multi-step Reasoning**

- **Instruction Tuning**

# Publications

**C-Eval: A Multi-Level Multi-Discipline Chinese Evaluation Suite for Foundation Models**
