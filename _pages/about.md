I'm a senior student majoring in Computer Science and Technology (IEEE Honor Class) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). 

My current research is on context window extension of Large Language Models (LLMs) at GAIR Lab, under the guidance of [Prof. Pengfei Liu](http://pfliu.com/). Before that, I researched LLMs' tool learning and evaluation, working closely with [Prof. Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/).

# Research

I'm generally interested in natural language processing, with a particular focus on enhancing LLMs' practicality and reliability. Here are some LLM-related topics that I'm currently interested in:

- **Long Sequence Modeling/Generation**

- **Trustworthy LLMs**

- **LLM Evaluation**

- **Multi-step Reasoning**

# Publications
**Extending LLMs' Context Window with 100 Samples**  [[preprint]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07004) [[github]](https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/Entropy-ABF)  
*<ins>Y. Zhang</ins>*, J. Li, P. Liu  
_Under Submission_  
**Brief**: We present a novel extension to Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) that efficiently extends the context window of LLaMA-2-Chat to 16,384 with only **100** samples and **6** training steps.

**C-Eval: A Multi-Level Multi-Discipline Chinese Evaluation Suite for Foundation Models**  [[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08322) [[github]](https://github.com/hkust-nlp/ceval) [[website]](https://cevalbenchmark.com)  
Y. Huang\*, Y. Bai\*, Z. Zhu, J. Zhang, J. Zhang, T. Su, J. Liu, C. Lv, *<ins>Y. Zhang</ins>*, J. Lei, Y. Fu, M. Sun, J. He  
_NeurIPS 2023 (Datasets and Benchmarks track)._  
**Brief**: The first comprehensive evaluation benchmark for foundation models in a Chinese context. C-Eval received over **140k** monthly downloads on HuggingFace and **1.3k** stars on GitHub.

**Learning to Adaptively Incorporate External Syntax through Gated Self-Attention**  
S. Hou, *<ins>Y. Zhang</ins>*, J. Kai, H. Xue, K. Yang, X. Wang, Z. Lin.  
_Under Review at COLING24_  
**Brief**: We propose a self-adaptive network that incorporates constituency grammar into Transformer models to guide machine translation tasks. Our method outperformed other syntax-related methods in 4 out of 5 machine translation datasets.

**Pygmtools: A Python Graph Matching Toolkit**  [[page]](http://jmlr.org/papers/v25/23-0572.html) [[github]](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/pygmtools) [[doc]](https://pygmtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

_Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR)._  
**Brief**: State-of-the-art graph matching solvers implemented in Python, supporting various backends including PyTorch, Numpy, Tensorflow, Paddle, etc.
