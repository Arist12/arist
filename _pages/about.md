I'm a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science (IEEE Honor Class) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

In the second semester of my sophomore year, I was fortunate to take [Prof. Zhouhan Lin](https://hantek.github.io/) Natural Language Processing course. During my free time, I also conducted research on constituent syntax under his guidance, which marked the beginning of my journey in natural language processing research. 

I'm currently working on enabling long context modeling of LLMs (Large Language Models) at GAIR Lab, supervised by [Prof. Pengfei Liu](http://pfliu.com/). Before that, I focused on tool learning in LLMs under the supervision of [Prof. Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/).

# Research

I'm generally interested in natural language processing, especially augmenting large language models. My current interests mainly lie on:

- **Long Context Extrapolation**

- **Tool Learning**

- **Multi-step reasoning**

# Publications

**C-Eval: A Multi-Level Multi-Discipline Chinese Evaluation Suite for Foundation Models**
