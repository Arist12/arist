I'm a senior student majoring in Computer Science and Technology (IEEE Honor Class) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). 

My current research is on context window extension of Large Language Models (LLMs) at GAIR Lab, under the guidance of [Prof. Pengfei Liu](http://pfliu.com/). Before that, I researched LLMs' tool learning and evaluation, working closely with [Prof. Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/).

# Research

I'm generally interested in natural language processing, with a particular focus on enhancing LLMs' practicality and reliability. Here are some LLM-related topics that I'm currently interested in:

- **Long Sequence Modeling/Generation**

- **LLM Evaluation**

- **LLM Agents and Tool Learning**

- **Multi-step Reasoning**

# Publications
**Extending LLMs' Context Window with 100 Samples**  
*<ins>Y. Zhang</ins>*, J. Li, P. Liu  
Under Submission  
**Brief**: We present a novel extension to Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) for LLMs' context window extension. Our method outperforms all baselines on various context-demanding tasks in both fine-tuning performance and robustness across different context window sizes. Notably, our method extends LLaMA-2-Chat to 16,384 with only **100** samples and **6** training steps, showcasing extraordinary efficiency. 

**C-Eval: A Multi-Level Multi-Discipline Chinese Evaluation Suite for Foundation Models**  
Y. Huang\*, Y. Bai\*, Z. Zhu, J. Zhang, J. Zhang, T. Su, J. Liu, C. Lv, *<ins>Y. Zhang</ins>*, J. Lei, Y. Fu, M. Sun, J. He  
NeurIPS 2023 (Datasets and Benchmarks track). [[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08322) [[github]](https://github.com/hkust-nlp/ceval) [[website]](https://cevalbenchmark.com) [[dataset]](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ceval/ceval-exam)  
**Brief**: The first comprehensive evaluation benchmark for foundation models in a Chinese context. C-Eval received over **120k** downloads on HuggingFace and more than **1.2k** stars on GitHub.

**Learning to Adaptively Incorporate External Syntax through Gated Self-Attention**  
S. Hou, *<ins>Y. Zhang</ins>*, J. Kai, H. Xue, K. Yang, X. Wang, Z. Lin.  
Under Review at COLING24  
**Brief**: We propose a self-adaptive network to incorporate constituency grammar information into Transformers to guide machine translation tasks. Our method outperformed other syntax-related methods in 4 out of 5 machine translation datasets.

**Pygmtools: A Python Graph Matching Toolkit**   
R. Wang, Z. Guo, W. Pan, *<ins>Y. Zhang</ins>*, J. Ma, N. Yang, Q. Liu, L. Wei, H. Zhang, C. Liu, Z. Jiang, X. Yang, J. Yan
