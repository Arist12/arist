I'm an incoming CS PhD student at UW-Madison, and I'm a senior student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), majoring in Computer Science and Technology (IEEE Honor Class)  

Currently, I work as a research intern at AWS Shanghai AI Lab, focusing on long-context LLMs. I'm also an honored member of GAIR Lab, advised by [Prof. Pengfei Liu](http://pfliu.com/). Before that, I worked closely with [Prof. Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/) and [Prof. Zhouhan Lin](https://hantek.github.io/).

# Research

I'm generally interested in NLP, with a particular focus on large generative models. Here are some LLM-related topics that I'm currently interested in:

- **Long-Context LLMs**

- **Trustworthy LLMs**

- **Interpretability and application of LLMs**


# Publications
**Dissecting Human and LLM Preferences**  [[preprint]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11296) [[github]](https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/Preference-Dissection)  
J. Li, F. Zhou, S. Sun, *<ins>Y. Zhang</ins>*, H. Zhao, P. Liu  
_Submitted to ACL 24_  
**Brief**: We dissect human and LLM preferences from 32 different models and conduct thorough analyses based on user-model conversations collected from various real-world scenarios.

**Extending LLMs' Context Window with 100 Samples**  [[preprint]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07004) [[github]](https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/Entropy-ABF)  
*<ins>Y. Zhang</ins>*, J. Li, P. Liu  
_Submitted to ACL 24_  
**Brief**: We present a novel extension to Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) that efficiently extends the context window of LLaMA-2-Chat to 16,384 with only **100** samples and **6** training steps.

**C-Eval: A Multi-Level Multi-Discipline Chinese Evaluation Suite for Foundation Models**  [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08322) [[github]](https://github.com/hkust-nlp/ceval) [[website]](https://cevalbenchmark.com)  
Y. Huang\*, Y. Bai\*, Z. Zhu, J. Zhang, J. Zhang, T. Su, J. Liu, C. Lv, *<ins>Y. Zhang</ins>*, J. Lei, Y. Fu, M. Sun, J. He  
_NeurIPS 2023 (Datasets and Benchmarks track)._  
**Brief**: The first comprehensive evaluation benchmark for foundation models in a Chinese context. C-Eval received over **140k** monthly downloads on HuggingFace and **1.3k** stars on GitHub.

**Learning to Adaptively Incorporate External Syntax through Gated Self-Attention**  
S. Hou, *<ins>Y. Zhang</ins>*, J. Kai, H. Xue, K. Yang, X. Wang, Z. Lin.  
_Under Review at COLING 24_  
**Brief**: We propose a self-adaptive network that incorporates constituency grammar into Transformer models to guide machine translation tasks. Our method outperformed other syntax-related methods in 4 out of 5 machine translation datasets.

**Pygmtools: A Python Graph Matching Toolkit**  [[paper]](http://jmlr.org/papers/v25/23-0572.html) [[github]](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/pygmtools) [[doc]](https://pygmtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  
R. Wang, Z. Guo, W. Pan, J. Ma, *<ins>Y. Zhang</ins>*, N. Yang, Q. Liu, L. Wei, H. Zhang, C. Liu, Z. Jiang, X. Yang, J. Yan  
_Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR)_  
**Brief**: State-of-the-art graph matching solvers implemented in Python, supporting various backends including PyTorch, Numpy, Tensorflow, Paddle, etc.
