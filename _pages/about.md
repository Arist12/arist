I'm a senior student majoring in Computer Science and Technology (IEEE Honor Class) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). 

My current research is on context window extension of Large Language Models (LLMs) at GAIR Lab, under the guidance of [Prof. Pengfei Liu](http://pfliu.com/). Before that, I researched LLMs' tool learning and evaluation, working closely with [Prof. Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/).

# Research

I'm generally interested in natural language processing, with a particular focus on improving LLMs' practicality, reliability, and safety. Here are some LLM-related topics that interest me:

- **Context Window Extension**

- **LLM Evaluation**

- **LLM Agents and Tool Learning**

- **Alignment**
  
- **Multi-step Reasoning**

# Publications
**Efficient Context Window Extension of LLMs via Entropy-Aware ABF**  
*<ins>Y. Zhang</ins>*, J. Li, P. Liu  
Under Submission  
**Brief**: We present a novel extension to Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) for better long-context fine-tuning performance of RoPE-based LLMs. Experiments show that our method surpasses other RoPE-Extending methods by a large margin on long-context benchmarks and achieves extraordinary converging speed by training a decent long-context language model with only **100** training samples and **6** training steps.

**C-Eval: A Multi-Level Multi-Discipline Chinese Evaluation Suite for Foundation Models**

**Brief**: The first comprehensive Chinese evaluation suite for foundation models. Received over **120k** downloads on HuggingFace and more than **1.2k** stars on GitHub.

**Learning to Adaptively Incorporate External Syntax through Gated Self-Attention**  
S. Hou, *<ins>Y. Zhang</ins>*, J. Kai, H. Xue, K. Yang, X. Wang, Z. Lin.  
Under Review at COLING24  
**Brief**: We propose a self-adaptive approach to incorporate constituency grammar information into Transformers. The proposed method outperformed other syntax-related methods in 4 out of 5 machine translation datasets.

**Pygmtools: A Python Graph Matching Toolkit**
