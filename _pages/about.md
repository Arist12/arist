I'm a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science (IEEE Honor Class) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I'm currently working on enabling long context extrapolation of LLMs (Large Language Models) as a research intern at Shanghai AI Laboratory, supervised by [Prof. Pengfei Liu](http://pfliu.com/). Before that, I focused on tool learning in LLMs under the supervision of [Prof. Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/).

# Research

I'm generally interested in natural language processing, especially augmenting large language models. My current interests mainly lie on:

- **Long Context Extrapolation**

- **Tool Learning**

- **Multi-step reasoning**

# Publications

**C-Eval: A Multi-Level Multi-Discipline Chinese Evaluation Suite for Foundation Models**
